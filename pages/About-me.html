      <h4>
        Overall
      </h4>
        <p2>Aside from what I've already showed above, there are still a few things I should tell you about myself. In my spare free time
          I enjoy RTS (real time strategy) games, so I can test my quick thinking and ideas against other opponents. Similar to chess. I also enjoy doing home repairs with the knowledge I've accumulated over the years. This ranges from simple tasks such as hanging shelves to mounting T.v's. I've also installed some plumbing and will soon be working on some ceiling repairs.
        As of the last couple of years I've taken an interest in marvel films and the intriguing universe they've made.
