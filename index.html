<p1>I like <b>History</b>, I enjoyed learning about general's and there tactics especially in WW II. Such generals included George S. Patton &
Erwin Rommel (The Desert Fox) along side with heros such as Franz Stigler & Guiseppe Lella (Pino). I find there success and stories very intruging considering how often they had to think outside the box to solve their problems. I also enjoy
    adding and removing hardware from computers to gain a better understanding of new and unique parts. I personally built my computer a handful of times for new parts Via word of mouth and youtube.
   <i>Greek Mythology</i> was always interesting to me and all the stories that came with it. Science has also
    caught my eye with <b>Physics</b> and <i>Anatomy</i> being very intricate.</p1>
<br><br>
  <p5>This book is a culmination of what I wrote above, it has heros and history of a painful time. This is something I think we should take notes in and not forget the past.</p5>
